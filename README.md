Submission for the AppSec Village at DEF CON 31, 2023

### It's _time_ to renew!
At Rose Video, the developers are hard at work building a new API to support the classic
movie rental business. This API is time-sensitive, as a new mobile app is coming early 
next year. As a new hire, you need to jump in and get your hands dirty in a clean fresh
API.

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites**
- docker and docker compose installed on your machine

Clone this repository, and run `docker compose up -d`. The main site will load on `localhost:8000`.
